## Paragraphs

Rebass is a library of highly-composable, primitive UI components for React, built with styled-components to keep styles isolated and reduce the need to write custom CSS in your application. Based upon a configurable design system, Rebassâ€™s props API makes building consistent, responsive web apps simpler and faster.
